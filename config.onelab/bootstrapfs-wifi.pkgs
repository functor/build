# first attempt for an extensible bootstrapfs contents
#
# the groupname should start with extension as the bootmanager 
# computes it as extension<nodegroup>
# the present file's name can be either
# (*) bootstrapfs-something.pkgs
# in which case the tarball will be elaborated at build-time
# (*) anything else otherwise
# 
# at runtime, the choice between tarball-install or yum install
# depends on whether the tarball can be downloaded or not
